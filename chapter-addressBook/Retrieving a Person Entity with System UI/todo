1) I will make sure that the simulator is reset
2) I will show that there are a few contacts that have already been added
    to the simulator by Apple and that they have various properties
3) There are no slides for this project so I will skip over this
4) I will show the storyboard and the button on the UI
5) I will then code ViewController.swift to the end
6) I will run the code on the simulator

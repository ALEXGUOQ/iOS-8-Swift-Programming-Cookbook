1) I will reset the simulator and explain that the app has an image in its
    Images.xcasstes which we will use to set the image for the person that
    we are going to create in the address book
2) there are no slides for this recipe
3) I will then program AppDelegate.swift to the end
4) I will run the app
5) I will show Richard Branson on the simulator and the image that
    has been added for that person

1) I will run through the slides first
2) I'll show people where to download the Hardware tools from the shortcut
    that I have in Safari under iOS favorites button
3) Then I will open the Accessory Simulator from Xcode and show them what I have
    already set up and will talk abit about different characteristics
    and properties of every accessory
4) I will then run through the ViewController.swift code
5) I will make sure the simulator is reset and then I will run the code on the
    simulator

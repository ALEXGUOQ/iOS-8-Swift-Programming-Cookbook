1) I'll show the slides
2) I'll then show the Health app and how they can get to weight information
3) Then I'll code the storyboard for the project
4) I'll then code ViewController.swift
5) Then I will make sure the simulator is reset and no weight info is entered
6) I'll then run the code and then save the data and run the code again and get the data
7) Then I will go back to the simulator and show that the weight info is entered

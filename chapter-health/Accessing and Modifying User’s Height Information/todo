1) I'll run through the slides
2) I'll then show them how to get to the height information in the Health app on simulator
3) Then I'll show them to set up the Capabilities for HealthKit in Xcode
4) I'll then show the storyboard of the app
5) I'll then introduce the code (be careful about the height8 macro, it has /* */ around it)
6) Then I'll run the code and save the data and close the simulator and run
    it again to see the data read back properly
7) Then I will show the results also shown in the Health app

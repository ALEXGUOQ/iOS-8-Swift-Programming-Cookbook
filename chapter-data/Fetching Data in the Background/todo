1) I will reset the simulator
2) Then I will show the data model and the Person.swift class briefly
3) I will then show the slides
4) And then I will code the AppDelegate.swift file
5) I will then put a breakpoint to where the objects are brought to the main
    context and run the code on the simulator and then I will call the println()
    on the firstName of the persons that were found and run the code again

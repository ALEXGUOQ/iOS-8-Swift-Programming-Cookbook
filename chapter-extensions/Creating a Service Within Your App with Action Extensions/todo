1) I'll show the slides
2) I'll then show the project and show how to add the Action Extension Target
3) I'll then show how the info.plist of the extension is configured to only
    allow text files
4) Then I will show the storyboard of the extension
5) I will then show the storyboard of the main project
6) I'll then code the ActionViewController.swift file
7) I'll then code the ViewController.swift file
8) I'll run the code on iPhone, put some text in and then press the Share button
    and enable the UPPERCASE extension and use it
